PREREQUISITES

    Proj4 C library (tested with 4.4.5)
    Perl            (tested with 5.8.0)
    PDLA             (tested with 2.3.4 with BadVals)

INSTALLATION

    1. If using a linux package manager and already have proj version 4 installed
        then ensure that it has the headers.  If not then Alien::Proj4 will run a
        system install and not provide the headers.  If you are on Windows then
        Alien::Proj4 will build them (Strawberry perl also provides them).  

    2. Make the makefiles with the command:
        shell> perl Makefile.PL

    3. Build the software with the command:
        shell> make
    
    4. Test the software with the command:
        shell> make test

    5. Install the software with the command:
        shell> make install

USAGE

    See the POD in the lib itself, and check out the test scripts.
